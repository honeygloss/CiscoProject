# CiscoProject
A cisco packet tracer consisting IPV6, VLAN, HSRP, OSPF.

This Cisco Network Simulation Project utilizes Cisco Packet Tracer to design and implement a robust and scalable network architecture. The project focuses on integrating advanced networking technologies including IPv6, VLANs, HSRP, and OSPF, providing a comprehensive learning experience for network engineers and students. Key components include:

IPv6 Implementation: Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 to ensure future-proofing and enhanced address space.
VLAN Configuration: Segregating network traffic into multiple VLANs to improve security, reduce broadcast domains, and enhance network performance.
HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol): Implementing HSRP for high availability and redundancy, ensuring continuous network operation and minimizing downtime in case of router failures.
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): Deploying OSPF for dynamic routing, optimizing the routing paths, and ensuring efficient network traffic management.
